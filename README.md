# Mercari-Price-Suggestion-Challenge
Mercari, Japans biggest community-powered shopping app. They'd like to offer pricing suggestions to sellers, but this is tough because their sellers are enabled to put just about anything, or any bundle of things, on Mercari's Marketplace.
Product pricing gets even harder at scale, considering just how many products are sold online. Clothing has strong seasonal pricing trends and is heavily influenced by brand names, while electronics have fluctuating prices based on product specs.
This Problem statement was uploaded on Kaggle competitions. In this competition, Mercari is challenging the participants to build an algorithm that automatically suggests the right product prices.
The Data provided consists of user inputted text descriptions of their products, including details like product category name, brand name, item condition.
